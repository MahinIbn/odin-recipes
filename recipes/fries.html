    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Use a sharp knife to carefully cut away the peel from the squash. Cut the squash into sticks like French fries. Arrange squash pieces on a baking sheet and season with salt.</p>
    <p>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, turning the fries over halfway through baking. Fries are done when they are starting to brown on the edges and become crispy.</p>
